"# HI.FI 🎯

> Non-custodial treasury pooling with AI guidance and deterministic execution.

## What is HI.FI?

HI.FI solves the "Trust Gap" in AI-driven DeFi by separating **advice** from **execution**. Users receive AI-generated portfolio strategies but maintain complete control—no transaction executes without explicit consent.

## Key Features

- **🔐 Non-Custodial:** You always control your funds
- **🤖 AI Advisory:** Smart portfolio recommendations without custody risk
- **🔗 Chain-Agnostic:** Deposit any token from any chain via LI.FI integration
- **📊 ERC-4626 Vaults:** Standardized, transparent yield-bearing pools
- **🛡️ Deterministic Execution:** Rule-based smart contracts with zero AI control
- **🚪 Scheduled Exits:** Controlled withdrawal windows to prevent bank runs

## How It Works

1. **Connect:** Link your wallet and complete a risk profile
2. **Deposit:** Use any token from any chain—automatically converted to pool base asset
3. **Review Plan:** AI proposes a portfolio strategy based on your preferences
4. **Sign & Deploy:** Explicitly approve the plan with your signature
5. **Earn Yield:** Funds automatically deploy to Arc protocol when threshold is met
6. **Exit Anytime:** Request withdrawal during scheduled exit windows

└── gateway/           # LI.FI integration for cross-chain deposits
```

## The Golden Rule

**Advice → Explicit Consent → Deterministic Execution → Observable Accounting → Controlled Exits**

AI can advise. Contracts can execute. But only **you** can authorize."
